# Overview of [Vote Plan](https://www.voteplan.org)

The purpose of this website is to aid people with deciding on their vote.

This is helpful because it can be difficult to take the time to decipher a ballot paper in a busy voting place.

Preparing your vote beforehand takes the guess work out of filling out the ballot paper.


## Flow for preparing a vote
